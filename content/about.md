Hello. I am a web page pretending to be Bharat. I've lived in
[Bristol][bristol] since 2012 apart from latter half of 2017 when I partnered
up with Kyla on a 6 month tour of Nepal, Thailand, Myanmar, Vietnam, Cambodia,
Laos and China.  I like spending my time in coffee shops, learning new stuff
([fast.ai][fastai], [smart contracts][strangelabs]), going to hackathons,
sampling vegan foods and collaborating on coding projects (_hint hint_).

At present, I work as a Software Engineer at [StackHPC][stackhpc] making HPC
cloud platform for research computing use case using [OpenStack][openstack].  

In 2017, I defended my doctoral thesis on [mass evacuation modelling][massevac]
at [University of Bristol][buncaer]. Feel free to check out my
[publications][scholar]. The best part of the doctoral training was going to
conferences and workshops in all these places:

- TGF 2015 - Delft, Netherlands
- CDAM 2015 - Lake Como, Italy
- SCCS 2015 - Granada, Spain
- AUM 2015 - Cambridge, UK
- PED 2014 - Delft, Netherlands
- SCCS 2014 Brighton, UK
- AUM 2014 - Cambridge, UK
- TGF 2013 - Julich, Germany
- AUM 2013 - Cambridge, UK

As I was writing up my thesis in 2016, I also worked at [Airbus][agi] for 9
months applying [deep reinforcement learning][drl] to optimise policy of
interaction between connected autonomous vehicles as part of a consortium
called [Flourish][flourish].

Prior to Bristol, I was living in Bath until 2012 to complete an undergraduate
Master's degree in Civil and Architectural Engineering at [University of
Bath][6east].

Going all the way back, I was born in western Nepal in a village called
[Burtibang][burtibang]. As my father was in the [Brigade of
Gurkhas][gurkhas], my mother and I went to join him in Hong Kong for 3 years
where my brother was born. I went back to living in [Kathmandu
Valley][kunwar-bhawan], some of which I spent with my extended family and
other 5 years in a boarding school. At the age of 13, I was reunited with my
parents in the UK where I've sampled living up North in Blackpool, down South
in Folkestone and Ashford and at present in the West Country.
