Hi, Bharat here! Welcome to my [website][website]. I live in [Bristol][bristol] and I am due to defend my doctoral thesis on [mass evacuation modelling][massevac] at [University of Bristol][buncaer] very soon. In the mean time, I have been immersed in applying [deep reinforcement learning][drl] to optimise policy of interaction between connected autonomous vehicles as part of a consortium called [Flourish][flourish] through my job at [Airbus Group Innovations][agi]. Prior to Bristol, I was living in Bath until 2012 to complete an undergraduate Masters degree in Civil and Architectural Engineering at [University of Bath][6east]. 

I like spending my time sitting in coffee shops, learning new things, organising, travelling and collaborating on coding projects (hint hint)!
