Hello. I am an about page pretending to be `brtknr` or `भरतकुँवर` in Nepalese. I
have lived in [Bristol][bristol] since 2012, a city that I grown to love. At
the end of 2019, the family has doubled in size with the arrival of our twins.
While I would rate the pandemic low for many things but it has been great for
optimising work/life balance. I do miss some aspects of commuting, e.g.
listening to my favourite podcasts] on my way to work but now I can do that
while I am out with the children sleeping in the pram instead. I still enjoy
spending my time in coffee shops, learning new things, going to
hackathons/meetups, sampling vegan food and collaborating on coding projects
(past projects: [fast.ai][fastai], [smart contracts][strangelabs]).

Until September 2021, I worked as a Software Engineer at [StackHPC][stackhpc]
making HPC cloud platform for research computing use case using
[OpenStack][openstack] and [Kubernetes][kubernetes].

In the latter half of 2017, I partnered up with Kyla and went on a 6 month tour
of Nepal, Thailand, Myanmar, Vietnam, Cambodia, Laos and China. Checkout some
of our [travel photos][kylaandbharatinasia].

In 2017, I defended my doctoral thesis on [mass evacuation modelling][massevac]
at [University of Bristol][buncaer]. Feel free to check out my
[publications][scholar]. The best part of the doctoral training was going to
conferences and workshops in all these places:

- TGF 2015 - Delft, Netherlands
- CDAM 2015 - Lake Como, Italy
- SCCS 2015 - Granada, Spain
- AUM 2015 - Cambridge, UK
- PED 2014 - Delft, Netherlands
- SCCS 2014 Brighton, UK
- AUM 2014 - Cambridge, UK
- TGF 2013 - Julich, Germany
- AUM 2013 - Cambridge, UK

As I was writing up my thesis in 2016, I also worked at [Airbus][agi] for 9
months applying [deep reinforcement learning][drl] to optimise policy of
interaction between connected autonomous vehicles as part of a consortium
called [Flourish][flourish].

Before moving to Bristol in 2012, I was living in Bath to complete an
undergraduate Master's degree in Civil and Architectural Engineering at
[University of Bath][6east].

Until 2009, I was living in Ashford with my parents while finishing up my
A-levels at Harvey Grammar School in Folkestone where we lived until 2007.

I was reunited with my parents and brother in 2003 near Kirkham, UK where I
completed my GCSEs at Carr Hill High School.

I lived in [Kathmandu Valley][kunwar-bhawan] from 1995, some of which I spent
with my mother and extended family but the last 5 years at a boarding school.

As my father was in the [Brigade of Gurkhas][gurkhas], my mother and I went to
join him in Hong Kong in 1991 for 3 years where my brother was born.

Going all the way back to 1989, I was born in western Nepal in a village called
[Burtibang][burtibang]. hello
