I often log into a remote SSH terminal to use an `ipython` shell. In doing so, it is necessary for me look at figures invoked by `matplotlib` as I am exploring and analysing data. For this, I have comfortably been using a combination of `screen` and `xpra`. However, I recently hesitantly upgraded my Ubuntu distribution from 14.04 Trusty Tahr to 16.04 Xenial Xerus. And with all upgrades, I expected minor breakages. Little did I realise that it would break `xpra` and interrupt my workflow sending me down a rabbit hole internet trawling for solutions. Turns out it is a known [issue] on on launchpad but the discussion has not been active for a while and the provided solutions were incomprehensible to a lay user. It appears that simply updating `xpra` to the latest version resolves the issue.

# TL;DR

Log into the report server:

{{< highlight bash >}}
ssh -Y username@remote
{{< /highlight >}}

On the remote server, update to the latest stable release of `xpra` which at the time of writing this was `2.0-r15319-1`. The update [instructions] which were not so obvious to find are as follows: 

{{< highlight bash >}}
# Administrator privileges
sudo su -
# Import the packager's key:
apt-get install curl
curl http://winswitch.org/gpg.asc | apt-key add -
# Xenial Xerus (16.04)
echo "deb http://winswitch.org/ xenial main" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/winswitch.list;
apt-get install software-properties-common >& /dev/null;
add-apt-repository universe >& /dev/null;
apt-get update;
apt-get install winswitch
{{< /highlight >}}

Now start an `xpra` server and attach to the session inside a `screen` session:

{{< highlight bash >}}
xpra start :10
xpra attach :10
{{< /highlight >}}

Press `Ctrl+a, d` to detach from the screen session. Now run the following on a separate `screen` session which should launch a beautiful empty plot on your client.

{{< highlight bash >}}
DISPLAY=:10 ipython --pylab -c 'plot()'
{{< /highlight >}}

# The rabbit-hole journal

To replicate the problem on a vanilla installation of Ubuntu 16.04 with the default installation of `xpra` version `0.15.8+dfsg-1 amd64` at the time of writing this blog:

{{< highlight bash >}}
ssh -Y username@remote
xpra start :10
{{< /highlight >}}

I tried to create a `plot()` as usual in `ipython` shell with `pylab` module using the default `Qt4Agg` backend:

{{< highlight bash >}}
DISPLAY=:10 ipython --pylab -c 'plot()'
{{< /highlight >}}

Which generated the following error:

>    : cannot connect to X server :10

I inspected the content of my log by running `cat ~/.xpra/:10.log`:

>   /usr/lib/xorg/Xorg.wrap: Only console users are allowed to run the X server
>   2017-03-15 15:03:37,413 
>   2017-03-15 15:03:37,413 Xvfb command has terminated! xpra cannot continue
>   2017-03-15 15:03:37,413 

I found these [discussions] to change `allowed_user=console` to `allowed_users=anybody` by running `sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg-legacy` for a GUI interface or alternatively by running the following `sed` command on `bash`:

{{< highlight bash >}}
sudo sed -i 's/allowed_users=console/allowed_users=anybody/' /etc/X11/Xwrapper.config
{{< /highlight >}}

Now when I ran `xpra start :10`, noticed that my `plot() function still was not working`. I inspected the log using `cat ~/.xpra/:10.log` again and saw the following:

>   ~/.xpra/IT050339-10 is not responding, waiting for it to timeout before clearing it.(EE)

I thought I would try launching `xpra` as a superuser so I ran `sudo xpra start :10`. When I inspected the log this time using `cat ~/.xpra/:10.log`, this is what I saw:

This was what I initially expected to see but when I ran `DISPLAY=:10 ipython --pylab -c 'plot()`, it still refused to work by producing the following error:

>   No protocol specified
>    : cannot connect to X server :10

Note that this is slightly different to earlier since it recognises that there is an open port but still struggling to connect. Next, I found that changing the permission for `~/.Xauthority` enabled me to query all the current sessions as follows:

{{< highlight bash >}}
sudo chown $USER:$USER ~/.Xauthority
xauth list | grep `uname -n`
{{< /highlight >}}

Which returned:

>	IT050339/unix:10  MIT-MAGIC-COOKIE-1  e65eee56adec473c9a04c74e2089f8b7

This allowed me to run `DISPLAY=:10 ipython --pylab -c 'plot()` without any errors. However, I was still unable to attach to the session using `xpra attach :10`.

This is when I decided to update `xpra` to the latest branch as per the instructions provided in [TL;DR](#tldr) which took a great difficulty to find which resolved everything.

## Lesson learnt

Persevere and keep trying new things.
