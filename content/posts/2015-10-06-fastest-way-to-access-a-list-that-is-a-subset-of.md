Say I have a list of objects called `agents` with 100,000 objects.

I have a second list called `agents_per_step` which refers to 39,393 objects in `agents`.

Say I need to access the agents in the reference list. What is the fastest way to access these objects?

I ran three tests:

1. Loop through a list directly containing `agent` objects
2. Loop through a list of indices referring to `agents` objects on a `list`
3. Loop through a list of indices referring to `agents` objects on a `dict`
 
I present the results below:

Turns out the winner is Method 1, looping through a list directly containing `agent` objects. Correct me if you can think of a way to make this run even faster!
