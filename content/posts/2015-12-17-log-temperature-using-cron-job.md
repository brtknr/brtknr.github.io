I have just set up a way to automatically log temperature using OSX terminal because my computer was frequently overheating and I wanted to investigate why. Here is breakdown of how I did it.

First of all, I installed [Temperature Monitor for OSX][temp-monitor] from this URL into the application folder.

On terminal, I entered the following command to edit `crontab` using `nano` text editor environment.

{{< highlight bash >}}
env EDITOR=nano crontab -e
{{< /highlight >}}

In the editor, I entered the following line which creates and appends date, time and  temperatures from all your built-in sensors at a minute interval to `~/Documents/temp.txt`. Feel free to change this to whatever you like.

{{< highlight bash >}}
*       *       *       *       *       date >> ~/Documents/temp.txt && /Applications/TemperatureMonitor.app/Contents/MacOS/tempmonitor -c -l -a >> ~/Desktop/temp.txt
{{< /highlight >}}

Press `CTRL+X` followed by `Yes` then `ENTER` to save the file. Then you're done! Wait for the file to be created on your desktop.

To filter the `DIODE` temperatures, simply enter the following command into the terminal.

{{< highlight bash >}}
cat ~/Desktop/temp.txt | grep 'DIODE'
{{< /highlight >}}

The latest temperature is shown at the bottom.
