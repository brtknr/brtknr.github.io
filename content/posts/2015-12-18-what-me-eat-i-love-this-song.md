Here is the lyrics borrowed from [this site][lyrics]:

	[Intro]
	Selamta (Greetings in Amharic)
	Ital (natural) we Ital and Vegan we Vegan
	I and I (we) eat from the earth and leave the animals to give birth
	No deaders (dead flesh) No fur No feathers
	When I tell people I don't eat meat, fish or dairy
	They look at me strangely
	They don't realise I eat a very wide variety
	Listen to Macka.B
	Yo!

	[Hook x2]
	Wha me eat them a wonder wha me eat
	When me tell them say me nu (don't) eat no fish nor no meat no
	Wha me eat them a wonder wha me nyam (eat)
	When me tell them say that I'm a vegan

	[Verse 1]
	Well me nu eat no meat no fish no cheese nor no egg
	Nothing with no foot no eye no wing nor no head
	Nothing with no lip no ears no toe nor no leg
	Prefer fruit and vegetables instead
	Me careful and me choosy about what I'm eating
	My medicines my food my food is my medicine
	When I tell people that me nu eat dem deh (those) things
	The look at me and scratch their chin
	And start wondering

	[Hook 2]
	Wha me eat them a wonder wha me eat
	When me tell them say me nu eat no fish nor no meat no
	Wha me eat them a wonder wha me nyam
	When me tell them say that I'm a vegan
	Wha me eat them a wonder wha me eat
	When me tell them say me nu eat no fish nor no meat no
	Wha me eat them a wonder wha me eat
	Dou you want to hear wha me eat?

	[Hook x2]

	[Verse 3]
	Look how me big and me say look how me strong
	Some people can't believe that me a vegetarian
	If you want a healthy body check the real Rastaman
	Cause Rastaman will tell you about the right nutrition
	Me get my Calcium ,my Sodium me get Potassium
	Me get my Zinc,me get my Iron and my Magnesium
	Instead of nyam(eat) the fish I nyam what the fish nyam
	Like the Kelp and Irish Moss that grow in the ocean
	Me get me Proteins and my Minerals, me get me Calories
	The Vitamins A the B the C the D the E,the F the G
	Essential fatty acids like the Omega 3
	Me get me fibre and me Carbohydrates in my body
	Don't forget your Water drink a few glasses a day
	The toxins in your body just flush them away
	Some of the things you eat stop in your body and decay
	When it comes to food I don't play
	We tell them say

	[Hook x2]

	[Verse 4]
	A lot of people would stop eat the meat
	If they had to kill the animals before they could eat
	Look at the way the animals them get treat
	The unsanitary conditions where some of them keep
	If we were supposed to eat the meat we would have sharp teeth
	You wouldn't need a Knife and fork can you see it
	You can't eat it raw you have to cook it complete
	And put on Vegetable seasoning to make it taste sweet

	[Hook x2]

	[Verse 5]
	It's up to you you can eat what you want to
	You can be a vegetarian and be healthy too
	There's a lot of choice around many foods are on view
	I just remember some more I forgot to tell you
	The Nectarines and tangerines and clementines and guanabana
	Lychhe, oats and ginger, kale and spirulina
	Mung beans, wholemeal pasta etc
