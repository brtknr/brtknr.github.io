Finding and deleting files and folders in OSX is simple. Open your terminal. In order to just find your files/folders (__non destructive__):

For files:

{{< highlight bash >}}
find . -name "Icon?" -type f
{{< /highlight >}}

For folders:

{{< highlight bash >}}
find . -name "Icon?" -type d
{{< /highlight >}}

For files and folders

{{< highlight bash >}}
find . -name "Icon?" -type f -o -name "Icon?" -type d
{{< /highlight >}}

In order to delete them, just add `-delete` operator to the end (__DESTRUCTIVE__):

For files:

{{< highlight bash >}}
find . -name "Icon?" -type f -delete
{{< /highlight >}}

For folders (although you may get a warning message saying 'No such file or directory'):

{{< highlight bash >}}
find . -name "Icon?" -type d -exec rm -rf {} \;
{{< /highlight >}}

The `?` symbol after the filename is a wildcard for a single character. To enable more characters, use `*` instead.
